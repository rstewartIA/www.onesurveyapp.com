# OneSurvey Product & Marketing Brief (source: InnovaDesigner + InnovaDesignerFE)

Last updated: 2026-01-29
Scope: This brief is derived from the actual frontend (InnovaDesignerFE) and backend (InnovaDesigner) codebase.

## 1) Product Summary (plain language)
OneSurvey is a web platform that unifies site surveys, floorplan design, asset/element mapping, photo documentation, task assignments, and reporting for technology and security sites. Teams can import a floorplan, scale it, place system elements (cameras, devices, etc.), capture photos and notes, and generate proposal-ready reports and installation documentation from the same workspace.

## 2) Who It Serves (primary audiences)
- Security integrators and low-voltage contractors
- Facilities and operations teams
- Enterprise IT and security operations
- Site managers and field technicians
- Security system integrators, low-voltage installers, and site delivery teams

## 3) Core Workflow (how the app is used)
1. Create a site and assign team members and client stakeholders.
2. Create a survey (floorplan) and scale it.
3. Drag-and-drop elements (devices) onto the floorplan; edit positions, labels, and metadata.
4. Add photos, notes, and attachments to elements and site albums.
5. Create assignments tied to elements or surveys; track status, due dates, comments, and attachments.
6. Generate reports (floorplan, survey data, BOM, installation, element survey, etc.) for proposals and handoff.
7. Use tickets for service requests and ongoing support.

## 4) Product Capabilities (feature inventory)

### Governance, Security, and Access
- Multi-tenant organizations.

## 5) Differentiators (what to emphasize)
- Single system from survey through install and service.
- Floorplan-first workflow with element-level data and visual context.
- Photo documentation tied directly to elements and reports.
- Field-of-view overlays for camera planning (security-specific advantage).
- Report automation for proposals, BOMs, and installation packages.

## 6) Primary Marketing Objective
Position OneSurvey as the fastest way for security and technology teams to capture accurate site surveys, design system layouts on scaled floorplans, and deliver proposal-ready documentation without bouncing between tools.

## 7) Messaging Pillars (for site copy)
1. Accuracy at the source: consistent surveys with visual floorplans and element mapping.
2. Speed to proposal: generate reports and BOMs without manual rework.
3. Team alignment: assignments, comments, and shared site context.
4. Field-to-office handoff: photos and notes are tied to exact elements.
5. Scalable governance: role-based access and audit trails.

## 8) Suggested SEO Themes (keywords to weave into copy)
- security site survey software
- floorplan-based survey tools
- security system design platform
- camera placement and field of view planning
- asset mapping and device documentation
- proposal-ready survey reports
- security integrator workflow software
